# {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI
{: #cdb-reference}

The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI plug-in offers extra methods of accessing the capabilities of the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} services. You can use {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI to manage and connect to 
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} 
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb_full}}
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}} 
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch_full}}
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}}
- {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq_full}}
- {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb_full}}

**Note**: The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI plug-in requires IBM Cloud CLI to be installed.

## The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
{: #install_cli}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI is a general-purpose developer tool that provides access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and services through a command-line interface.

An introduction and installation instructions are available on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI Getting Started page](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started). If you install the CLI from the cURL command that is provided, you get a selection of extra plug-ins and extensions for multiple IDEs.
 
You can install just the stand-alone package from the [Installing the stand-alone IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) page. 

Access to services via {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI is governed through Identity and Access Management. In order to use the CLI to view or manage a service (or to grant privileges to another user on your account), you must set the correct permissions. For more information about IAM management, see the [IAM Getting Started tutorial](/docs/account?topic=account-access-getstarted)

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI plug-in
{: installing_cli_plugin}

Once you have the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, [login](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login) and ask it to install the cloud databases plug-in. 
 
`ibmcloud plugin install cloud-databases`
 
Use `ibmcloud cdb help` for a list of commands and usage information.

## `ibmcloud cdb help`
{: #help}

Display help for the plug-in. Alone, this command displays the available top-level commands. Followed by another command, it displays specific help for that command.

```
ibmcloud cdb help [<command>]
```

**Command options**  
No command-specific options.
 
**Examples**
Get help on the task-show command.
```
ibmcloud cdb help task-show
```

## Tasks
{: #tasks}

Tasks are created whenever you perform an action on your deployment. Tasks include things like taking a backup, group scaling, and changing a user password. Most `cdb` commands poll the running task and exit when it completes. You can change this behavior with the `--nowait` flag, which returns task information and exits. Records of successful tasks are shown for 24 - 48 hours, and unsuccessful tasks are shown for 7 - 8 days. A historical record of tasks from any time period is available through the [Activity Tracker integration](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-activity-tracker).

### `ibmcloud cdb deployment-tasks-list`
{: #deployment-tasks-list}

Short version - `tasks`

Displays a list of all tasks that have been run on a specified deployment since it was created. Each task is displayed with its CRN, readable description, percentage completeness, status, and date of creation.

### `ibmcloud cdb task-show`
{: #task-show}

Short version - `task`
